# GRPO Three-Seed Confirmatory Block notebook

Running log for this experiment. Newest entry first. This is a lab notebook, not
a claims surface; the signed prose lives in `AMENDMENT.md` and the machine state
in `experiment.yaml`.

### 2026-07-31 — draft scaffolded, gates proposed, NOT signed

Drafting pass only. Nothing signed, nothing committed, nothing launched.

Scaffolded with `bin/exp new grpo-three-seed-confirmatory --title "GRPO
Three-Seed Confirmatory Block" --type training-run`. Filled `AMENDMENT.md`,
`cell.yaml`, `gates.yaml`, and the manifest's `question` / `checkpoint` /
`instrument.configs` / `inputs`. `bin/exp validate` passes (99 experiments, no
warning against this slug — `instrument.modules` is empty, so no persistence
declaration is required). `bin/exp regen` run after the manifest edits.

`prediction:` and `falsifier:` are deliberately left EMPTY in the manifest, and
the corresponding AMENDMENT.md sections carry explicit empty-slot markers. The PI
fills the prediction and the lead fills the orchestrator prediction at sign time;
`bin/exp sign` refuses while either field is blank, so the tooling enforces it.
The gates and falsifier in `gates.yaml` are marked `status: proposed` and are
drafting proposals for lead adjudication, not settled thresholds.

**Pre-sign feasibility probe: NOT YET DONE — blocking for sign.** The
experiment-runner reference requires confirming every arm is constructible from
data that exists before signing. `scratch/schema_response_confidence/` is
uncommitted and absent from this worktree, so the four training datasets could
not be inspected. Before sign, rebuild them from
`archive/experiment/phase1/grpo/build_schema_response_confidence_datasets.py
--include-ambiguous-middle` and record here: path, row count, and the clean-SFT
audit against the frozen Amendment E numbers (14,943 rows / 7,981 known / 6,414
unknown / 548 ambiguous / 2,489 unique targets / range [0.3508, 0.90],
`experiments/probe-scaled-response-confidence/AMENDMENT.md:199-206`). A mismatch
is a hard stop.

**Open items carried to the lead** (detail in AMENDMENT.md):

- Amendment G overlap. `best-stack-replication-scale-gate` (DRAFT) already
  registers the same seed-2/3 replication for the single best stack. This block
  is a strict superset; both cannot be signed as written.
- Lane. PROTOCOL v0.3 §3.4 scopes the 3090 as the dev/smoke lane, not the matrix
  lane (`archive/docs/protocols/phase1/PROTOCOL.md:543-545`). This block is a
  serial tens-of-hours matrix on the 3090. Flagged, not resolved.
- Intermediate-stage gate evals. Proposed: keep both the 192-row bounded smokes
  (already frozen by Amendment F §8, non-discretionary) and the full evals on the
  stage-1 base and stage-2 arms (they are terminal arms and the G1 denominator,
  not intermediates).
- Budget correction. Measured seed-1 full-eval wall-clock is 21–41 minutes per
  arm, not ~4 h; ~4 h is the total across all eight evals in a seed. The ~24 h
  training figure per seed holds (measured 26.2 h).
